    "### Body Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In an initial approach, body and lung segmentation were performed on CT slices from the LIDC dataset using intensity-based thresholding in the Hounsfield Unit (HU) domain. Body segmentation was achieved by isolating pixels with attenuation values above −500 HU, corresponding approximately to soft tissues and bones, while excluding air and background regions. The resulting binary mask was refined through morphological operations, including small object removal, binary closing, and hole filling, to eliminate noise and produce a continuous body region. The cleaned body mask was then applied to the CT image to exclude non-anatomical areas and improve the definition of the region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, lung segmentation was attempted within the body mask by selecting pixels with intensities between −1000 HU and −400 HU, corresponding to pulmonary parenchyma and air-filled regions. Morphological filters were again applied to reduce artifacts and ensure the connectivity of the lung structures, and the two largest connected components were retained to represent the left and right lungs. However, despite these refinements, the lung segmentation process exhibited instability, as reflected in inconsistent region detection across slices and occasional omission of lung structures, as illustrated in the example below. This instability motivated the use of body segmentation alone for subsequent feature extraction to ensure reproducibility and robustness.\n",

    "This preprocessing technique ensures that each pixel represents the same physical distance in all directions. In medical imaging, scans from different patients or devices may have varying pixel spacing due to differences in acquisition protocols or equipment. If these differences are not corrected, measurements and features extracted from the images can be inconsistent or misleading. By resampling images to a uniform pixel spacing, we enable accurate quantitative analysis, fair comparison between scans, and reliable application of automated algorithms such as segmentation or radiomics. This step is essential for reproducibility and robustness in medical image processing workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hounsfield Unit (HU) windowing is a technique used to enhance the visualization of specific tissue types in CT images by selecting a relevant range of HU values. Each tissue in the body has a characteristic HU value (e.g., air is approximately -1000 HU). By applying an appropriate HU range, irrelevant structures and noise outside the desired interval are suppressed, improving the contrast and clarity of the anatomical regions of interest, such as lungs. This process facilitates more accurate segmentation and feature extraction in medical image analysis. For this study, a HU range of [-1200, 600] was applied to exclude undesired tissue densities effectively."
